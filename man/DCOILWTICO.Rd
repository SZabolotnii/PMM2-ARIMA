\title{WTI Crude Oil Prices}
\format{
A data frame with daily observations and 2 variables:
\describe{
  \item{observation_date}{Date of observation (Date class)}
  \item{DCOILWTICO}{WTI crude oil price in US dollars per barrel (numeric)}
}
}
\source{

}
\usage{
DCOILWTICO
}
\description{
Daily West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices from the Federal Reserve
Economic Data (FRED) system. This dataset is used in the empirical case study
to demonstrate the PMM2 method for ARIMA parameter estimation with non-Gaussian
innovations.
}
\details{
This dataset contains daily spot prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
crude oil, Cushing, Oklahoma. WTI is a light, sweet crude oil that serves
as a benchmark for oil pricing. The data is used to compare PMM2 estimation
with classical maximum likelihood and OLS methods for ARIMA models.

The time series typically exhibits:
\itemize{
  \item Non-constant variance (heteroskedasticity)
  \item Asymmetric innovations
  \item Heavy-tailed distributions
}
}
